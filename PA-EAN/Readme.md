## PA-EN

<p> The Repositry presents PA-EAN Architecture. PA-EAN uses the architecture of network presented in [1]. <br>
The code of PA-Net is modified version of the code by Deudon et. el [1]. The github link to their work can be found [here](https://github.com/MichelDeudon/encode-attend-navigate).
</p>


In this repo user can visualize Pareto Fronts generated by PA-EAN for BTSP for different city sizes. The requirements to run the code are:
<ul>
<li>Python 3.6</li>
<li>Tensorflow 1.15 </li>
<li>sklearn </li>
<li>matplotlib </li>
</ul>

To run the code for  200 city MOTSP,  Go into the PANet directory  and run the following command:

<code>python PA_net_test.py -ct 200 </code>

The output will be displayed as a plot and the values of objective functions will be saved in .csv fileTo train your own network run:

<code> python PA_net_train.py </code>
